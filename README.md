.vim files for SELinux
ftdetect and syntax .vim files.
Copy or make sym-links inside  `$VIMRUNTIME/syntax/` and `$VIMRUNTIME/ftdetect/` dirs.

These are some PoC vim sytanx files.  They are not complete. I do plan to complete them. Progress is determined by how long I spend waiting for code to compile. :P
I want to implement sytax *checking* rather then just highlighting, I have not figured out how to implement a full grammar in vim yet.
